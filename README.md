# What is RESTORE?
RESTORE: REconStruction with Texture-based Object REfinement

The aim of this project is the realization of a hard- and software system for
3D reconstruction. An object is placed on a turntable and automatically 
photographed by a static, calibrated camera from several viewing angles. The
obtained images are then segmented and a rough 3D reconstruction of the object
will be created (so called visual hull). The texture of the object will then be
used to refine the 3D reconstruction.
